Task: Write an algorithm and a C++ program that uses a loop structure to add and print all the numbers divisible by 7, between 1 and 100.

Algorithm:
- Declare variables
  - i (int)
  - sum (int)
- Use for loop to iterate over 1-100 
  - Use if (i % 7 == 0)
    - print i
    - add i to sum
- Print sum
