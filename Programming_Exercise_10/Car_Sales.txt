Objectives: A car daler has 10 salespersons. Each saleperson keeps track of the number of cars sold each month and reports it to the management at the end of the month. The management keeps the data in a file and assigns a number, 1 to 10, to each salesperson. 

Rewrite the following program and use a dynamic array of 10 components of type into to store the number of cars sold by each salesperson. The program outputs the total number of cars sold at the end of each month, and outputs the saleperson number selling the maximum number of cars (assume that data is in file cars.txt).
