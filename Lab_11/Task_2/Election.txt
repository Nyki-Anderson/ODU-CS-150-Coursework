Task 2:
Write an algorithm and a C++ program that allows the user to enter the last names of five candidates in a local election and the number of votes received by each candidate. The program should then use dynamic arrays to hold the data and output each candidateâ€™s name, the number of votes received, and the percentage of the total votes received by the candidate. Your program should also output the winner of the election.
