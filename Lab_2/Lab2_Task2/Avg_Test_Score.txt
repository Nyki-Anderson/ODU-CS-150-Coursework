Task 2: Design an algorithm to find the average of four test scores. The four test scores are weighted equally.

1. Declare all variables as double
  - test1
  - test2
  - test3
  - test4
  - avg

2. Request user input for each of the four tests

3. Calculate the average of the four test scores using the following equation:

  avg = (test1 + test2 + test3 + test4) / 4

4. Output the average of the four test scores
